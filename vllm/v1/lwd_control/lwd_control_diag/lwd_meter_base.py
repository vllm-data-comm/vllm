"""Interval gate and span accumulator shared by the LWD meters.

A meter is a resident counter read from a scheduling thread, so it must
cost a few adds per step and report rarely enough that the logging cannot
become the thing being measured. Reporting is edge triggered by the
interval rather than scheduled, so an idle deployment stops logging
instead of printing zeros.

Meter lines go to the native logger, not `lwd_logger`: the rates they
measure are only meaningful on a run whose per-step LWD logging is off
(VLLM_LWD_LOG_LEVEL=disable), and a meter silenced by the very switch the
measurement needs would have nothing to report. The native logger adds no
prefix of its own, so the "[lwd]" tag is written into each format string
to keep these few lines greppable among the native ones.

All meters share one logger, declared here rather than per module. A
meter named after its own module lands under `vllm_ascend.*` on the
worker side, and vLLM's logging config only installs a console handler
on `vllm`: those lines would go to the Ascend file handler while the
engine's went to the console, and the two halves of one step would never
appear in the same log. Reading these numbers means lining them up
against each other, so they have to share a stream.
