"""Edge-side client of a cloud DP coordinator: FIRST_REQ wake-up.

A MoE multi-DP cloud runs its engines on the native DP engine core, whose
wave coordination pauses idle engines; the cloud has no front-end traffic
of its own, so nothing would ever send the new-request message that wakes
a wave. The edge -- the cloud's front-end stand-in -- sends FIRST_REQ
(engine dp_idx, wave 0) when a request is admitted while the engines may
be paused; wave 0 is a safe stale value, the coordinator turns a stale
wave into a broadcast to every engine. Stats coming back are logged for
reconciliation only: routing decisions use the local per-DP accounts.

Two directions, two threads, so two sockets: the engine thread writes
wake-ups, the stats thread reads stats, and neither ever touches the
other's socket. A zmq socket is not thread-safe, so one shared socket
would need a lock -- and a recv loop can only wait by holding that lock
across a poll, which turns every wake-up into a wait for the poll to
expire. Under a request stream that waiting compounds: the engine thread
releases and re-acquires nothing while the stats thread takes the lock
straight back, so admission stalled for seconds per request rather than
the one poll period the arrangement promised.

The wake socket sends no subscription byte, because it never reads. The
coordinator serves both from the one XPUB endpoint and tells them apart
by payload -- `\\x01`/`\\x00` are subscriptions to ignore, anything else
is a wake-up (`vllm/v1/engine/coordinator.py`). Native reaches the same
arrangement from the other side: its front-end hands wake-ups to the
stats task over an inproc pair, so there too the stats socket has a
single thread. Here the two are kept apart instead, which also keeps the
wake-up off the stats thread's critical path.
