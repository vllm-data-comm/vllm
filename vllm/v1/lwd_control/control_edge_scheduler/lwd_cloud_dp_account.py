"""Per-cloud-DP account of the edge scheduler.

One account holds everything the edge knows about one cloud DP rank: its
seqno stream (the UP pairing contract is per channel, so every engine has
its own), its pending prefill batches, its request load and its gate
state. The scheduler keeps one account per DP connection plus one routing
table (request id -> dp_idx) that is pinned at admission and never
changes: a request's KV and scheduler state live only in its target
engine, so every chunk, abort and result travels through the account of
the engine the request was routed to.

Load counts are maintained incrementally on the same transitions that
change the routing table, instead of rescanning every request on every
gate check.
