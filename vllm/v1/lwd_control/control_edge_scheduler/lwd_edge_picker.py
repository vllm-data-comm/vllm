"""Pure functions for edge-side prefill batch assembly: resume-first +
FCFS prefix + tail truncation (PD_mix is the only supported form; the
single-request escape hatch for PD-disaggregated mode was removed along
with the phase machine).

chunk semantics follow lwd_chunked_prefill_design.md §3.1; called by the
LwdEdgeScheduler adapter layer after it assembles candidates. Inputs and
outputs are all plain values with no scheduler state, so the logic is
table-driven testable.
